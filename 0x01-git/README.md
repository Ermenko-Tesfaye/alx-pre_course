What is Git?
***
Git is the most popular version control system. Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: 
tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing
source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
